relx_fixup
=====

A rebar3 plugin....

Remove unneeded files from relx generated release

The plugin is supposed to be run after rebar3 release (via provider_hook).

Unless erts is included in the release and dev_mode is false the plugin will
do nothing.

When run the plugin will:

1. remove all files in the erts-* sub-directory of the release that
are not listed in erts_whitelist and then recursively remove all empty
directories under erts-*

2. remove all files in the lib sub directories of the release that
match the wildcards in lib_rm_wildcards and then recursively remove all empty
directories in lib

3. copy releases/$VSN/$NAME.boot to releases/$VSN/start.boot
